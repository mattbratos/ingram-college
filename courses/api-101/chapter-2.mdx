# Chapter 2: HTTP Basics

## Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the underlying communication protocol that forms the backbone of web interactions: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). As junior web developers, understanding HTTP is essential for effectively working with APIs. We'll explore how HTTP powers API communication, examine the various HTTP methods, and break down the components of HTTP requests and responses.

## Overview of the HTTP Protocol

HTTP is a protocol used by the web for transferring information between servers and clients, such as browsers or applications.

### Key Characteristics of HTTP

- **Stateless**: Each HTTP request from a client to server is independent. The server does not retain session information.
- **Text-based**: HTTP messages are human-readable.
- **Request/Response Nature**: Clients send requests, and servers return responses.

### How HTTP Works

When you enter a URL in a browser, your browser constructs an HTTP request that is sent to the web server. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which the browser displays as a webpage.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define actions taken on resources. The primary methods used in APIs are:

### GET

- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **Characteristics**: Safe, idempotent, cacheable.
- **Use Case Example**: Fetch a list of users.

```python
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function fetchUsers() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users');
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users);
}

fetchUsers();
```

### POST

- **Purpose**: Submit data to be processed to a server.
- **Characteristics**: Not idempotent.
- **Use Case Example**: Create a new user account.

```python
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function createUser() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane@example.com'})
  });
  
  const user = await response.json();
  console.log('User created:', user);
}

createUser();
```

### PUT

- **Purpose**: Update an existing resource.
- **Characteristics**: Idempotent.
- **Use Case Example**: Update user information.

```python
async function updateUser() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users/1', {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({email: 'jane_doe@example.com'})
  });

  const updatedUser = await response.json();
  console.log('User updated:', updatedUser);
}

updateUser();
```

### DELETE

- **Purpose**: Remove a resource.
- **Characteristics**: Idempotent.
- **Use Case Example**: Delete a user.

```python
async function deleteUser() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users/1', {
    method: 'DELETE'
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    console.log('User deleted successfully');
  } else {
    console.log('Failed to delete user');
  }
}

deleteUser();
```

## Headers, Status Codes, and Responses

### HTTP Headers

Headers provide essential metadata about the request or response:

- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the resource.
- **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating the user agent with the server.
- **User-Agent**: Information about the user agent originating the request.

### HTTP Status Codes

Status codes inform about the result of the HTTP request:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: A new resource has been successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error.

### Constructing Responses

When a server processes a request, it typically returns a status code along with a body, often in JSON format, that provides the requested data or an error message.

## Exercises

1. **Practical Exercise: Build a Simple HTTP Client**

   - Use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a public API, such as [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), and display a list of posts.
   
   ```python
   import fetch from 'node-fetch';

   async function fetchPosts() {
     const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
     const posts = await response.json();
     console.log(posts);
   }

   fetchPosts();
   ```

2. **Assignment: Implement POST and PUT Requests**

   - Write functions to create a new user and update existing user data using POST and PUT requests on a mock API like JSONPlaceholder.

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we explored the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol, crucial for API communication. We covered the key HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—and discussed how headers and status codes provide context for HTTP requests and responses. By understanding these concepts, you now have a solid foundation to make and handle HTTP requests, an essential skill in web development.
