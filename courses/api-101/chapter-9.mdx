# Chapter 9: Real-World API Projects

Welcome to the chapter that brings everything together! You're about to embark on creating a real-world web application powered by APIs. This chapter will guide you through planning, implementing, testing, and deploying a complete API-driven project. Ready to see how all the pieces fit together? Let's dive in!

## Introduction to the Chapter's Topic

In previous chapters, you've learned the fundamentals of APIs, explored asynchronous programming, and even built your own APIs. Now, you'll apply this knowledge in a practical project that mimics real-world scenarios you'll encounter as a web developer. This experience will not only solidify your understanding but also provide you with a portfolio piece to showcase your skills.

## Project Planning and Requirement Gathering

### Understanding the Problem

Before jumping into code, it's crucial to understand the problem you're solving. Here, we'll outline a basic project: **Building a Weather Dashboard** using a third-party weather API.

#### Project Requirements

- **User Interface (UI):** Design a responsive dashboard where users can search for weather conditions by city.
- **API Use:** Utilize a public weather API to fetch current weather data and display it to the user.
- **Features:**
  - Search functionality for cities.
  - Display of temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
  - Error messages for invalid requests.

### Tools and Technology Stack

For this project, we'll leverage:
- **React** for building the UI.
- **JavaScript** for handling data manipulation and interaction.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development practices.
- A public weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap.

### Designing the Architecture

Sketch out the key components:
- **City Search Component:** For user input.
- **Weather Display Component:** To show weather data.
- **API Service:** To handle HTTP requests.

## Implementing APIs in a Live Project

### Setting Up the React Project

Begin by setting up your React app with TypeScript. Use tools like Create React App to streamline the process.

```bash
npx create-react-app weather-dashboard --template typescript
```

### Creating Components

#### City Search Component

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const CitySearch: React.FC<{ onSearch: (city: string) => void }> = ({ onSearch }) => {
  const [city, setCity] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = () => {
    onSearch(city);
    setCity('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={city}
        onChange={(e) => setCity(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter city"
      />
      <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CitySearch;
```

#### Weather Display Component

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface WeatherProps {
  temperature: number;
  humidity: number;
  conditions: string;
}

const WeatherDisplay: React.FC<WeatherProps> = ({ temperature, humidity, conditions }) => (
  <div>
    <h3>Weather Conditions</h3>
    <p>Temperature: {temperature}Â°C</p>
    <p>Humidity: {humidity}%</p>
    <p>Conditions: {conditions}</p>
  </div>
);

export default WeatherDisplay;
```

### Implementing API Calls

Use an `ApiService` class to manage API interactions.

```tsx
import axios from 'axios';

const API_KEY = 'your_api_key'; // Enter your OpenWeatherMap API key here
const API_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather';

export class ApiService {
  static async fetchWeather(city: string) {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(API_URL, {
        params: {
          q: city,
          appid: API_KEY,
          units: 'metric',
        },
      });
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error fetching weather data');
    }
  }
}
```

### Integrating Components and Logic

In your main application component, manage state and handle API logic.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import CitySearch from './CitySearch';
import WeatherDisplay from './WeatherDisplay';
import { ApiService } from './ApiService';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState<any>(null);

  const onSearch = async (city: string) => {
    try {
      const data = await ApiService.fetchWeather(city);
      setWeatherData({
        temperature: data.main.temp,
        humidity: data.main.humidity,
        conditions: data.weather[0].description,
      });
    } catch {
      alert('City not found or API error');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <CitySearch onSearch={onSearch} />
      {weatherData && <WeatherDisplay {...weatherData} />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Testing and Deploying Your API-Driven Application

### Testing the Application

Ensure your application behaves correctly.

- **Functional Testing:** Use tools like Jest to test individual functions and components.
- **UI Testing:** Verify the user interface and user interactions.
  
```bash
# Example command to run tests
npm test
```

### Deploying Your Application

Deploy your completed project. Options include:

- **Vercel** (ideal for React and Next.js projects)
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**

Follow their respective documentation for deployment steps.

## Practical Exercises or Assignments

1. **Extend the Weather Dashboard:**
   - Add a feature to display a 5-day weather forecast.
   - Implement a loading spinner for API requests.
   
2. **Create Your Own API:**
   - Set up a simple Node.js API that collects user feedback.
   - Integrate your own API with the React application.

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, you've learned how to plan, implement, and deploy a real-world API project. By creating a Weather Dashboard, you practiced integrating third-party APIs, handling dynamic data in React, and utilizing TypeScript for better code management. With the completed project, you now have a practical example to showcase your skills in building modern, API-driven web applications. Keep practicing with different APIs and projects to continue honing your skills!
