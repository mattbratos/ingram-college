# Chapter 3: Integrating APIs with React

Welcome to Chapter 3 of "API 101 for Junior Web Devs." In this chapter, we'll delve into the exciting world of integrating APIs within React applications. Whether you're building an application that fetches data from a weather API or posting information to a user database, understanding how to efficiently connect your React app to external APIs is a crucial skill for any modern web developer. Let's jump in!

## Introduction

Integrating APIs into React applications allows your web apps to become dynamic, responding to user interactions and displaying real-time data sourced from the web. In this chapter, you'll learn to set up a React application, use React hooks for handling API calls, render data from these responses, and manage loading states and errors effectively.

## Setting Up a React Application

Before we dive into the integration part, let's ensure we have a React environment ready to go.

### Creating a React App

The fastest way to set up a React project is by using Create React App. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app api-integration-example
cd api-integration-example
npm start
```

This will create a new React project named `api-integration-example` and start a development server.

### Project Structure

You'll see a standard project structure with the main files in the `src` directory:
- `App.js`: The main component where we'll set up our API calls
- `index.js`: The entry point of the React app

## Using Hooks for API Calls (useEffect and useState)

### Understanding Hooks

React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` transform how we manage state and side-effects in functional components.

- **useState**: Allows you to manage component-level state.
- **useEffect**: Used for running side-effects, such as fetching data or setting up subscriptions.

### Implementing API Calls using Hooks

Let's implement a simple API call using `fetch` to get data from a public API.

1. Install axios for more consistent and features-rich HTTP requests (optional):

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

2. Update `App.js` to use `axios` and React hooks:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
        setData(response.data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error.message);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Rendering Data from API Responses

In the above code example, we render a list of posts from a placeholder API. Each post's title is displayed in a list item. Rendering the data is just a matter of looping over your state variable holding the data and returning JSX for each item.

### Handling Conditional Renders

When dealing with asynchronous data fetching:
- Use conditional rendering to show `Loading...` text when data is being fetched.
- Display error messages if API requests fail.

## Handling Loading States and Errors in React

### Managing Loading States

In our example, a `loading` state is used to determine when to show a loading message.

### Error Handling

Proper error handling is vital when dealing with API calls. Here, we catch errors in our `fetchData` function and update the error state accordingly to inform the user about what went wrong.

## Practical Exercise

### Exercise: Fetch User Data

1. Create a new component `UserList.js` to fetch and display a list of users.
2. Use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` API for your data source.
3. Implement loading and error states as shown in the chapter.
4. Display the users in a tabular format with columns for ID, Name, and Email.

Hints:
- Use the same `useEffect` and `useState` hooks.
- Don't forget to handle loading and error states.

### Solution Example

```jsx
// UserList.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUsers = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
        setUsers(response.data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error.message);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchUsers();
  }, []);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User List</h1>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {users.map(user => (
            <tr key={user.id}>
              <td>{user.id}</td>
              <td>{user.name}</td>
              <td>{user.email}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserList;
```
