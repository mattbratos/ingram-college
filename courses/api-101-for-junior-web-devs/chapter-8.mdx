# Chapter 8: Integrating APIs with Next.js

Welcome to Chapter 8! In this chapter, we're diving into the practical world of integrating APIs into Next.js applications. If you're familiar with React, you'll find Next.js to be an exciting extension for building server-rendered React applications. By the end of this chapter, you'll have hands-on experience in setting up Next.js projects, making API calls both server-side and client-side, and building a small example app.

## Introduction to Integrating APIs with Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables you to build fast, server-rendered applications. One of its strengths is handling data fetching, whether it's done on the server during render time or client-side after the page loads. In this chapter, we'll cover the following key topics:

- Setting up a Next.js project
- Making API calls during server-side rendering (SSR)
- Fetching data in static site generation (SSG) and dynamic pages
- Building a simple example app to reinforce concepts

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Before we dive into API integrations, let's set up a basic Next.js project. You'll need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Create a Next.js App

To create a new Next.js app, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

This creates a new directory `my-next-app` with a starter Next.js project.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

To start your server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your Next.js app in action.

## Making API Calls During Server-Side Rendering

Next.js allows us to fetch data during server-side rendering, making our applications SEO-friendly and able to quickly render with data on the first load.

### Using `getServerSideProps`

The `getServerSideProps` function lets you fetch data and send it to your component as props during the server-side phase.

```javascript
// pages/serverside.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { post: data }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}

const ServerSidePage = ({ post }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{post.title}</h1>
    <p>{post.body}</p>
  </div>
);

export default ServerSidePage;
```

## Fetching Data in Static and Dynamic Pages

You'll often want to fetch data at build time for static pages or dynamically on the client side.

### Using `getStaticProps` for Static Generation

`getStaticProps` allows you to fetch data at build time, useful for static site generation (SSG).

```javascript
// pages/static.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { posts: data.slice(0, 3) }, // Fetch the first 3 posts
    revalidate: 10, // Re-gen page every 10s if no request
  };
}

const StaticPage = ({ posts }) => (
  <div>
    {posts.map((post) => (
      <div key={post.id}>
        <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        <p>{post.body}</p>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
);

export default StaticPage;
```

### Dynamic Routes and `getStaticPaths`

When creating pages for dynamic routes, use `getStaticPaths` together with `getStaticProps`.

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id.toString() },
  }));

  return { paths, fallback: false };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return { props: { post } };
}

const PostPage = ({ post }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{post.title}</h1>
    <p>{post.body}</p>
  </div>
);

export default PostPage;
```

## Example Project: Building a Simple App with Next.js and an API

Let's consolidate our learning by building a simple blog reader app with pages to list posts and view individual post details.

### Exercise: Implementing the Blog Reader

1. **Create a page to list blog posts**: Use `getStaticProps` to fetch a list of posts and display them as links.
2. **Create a dynamic route to view post details**: Use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` to fetch and render individual post details.

### Suggested API for Project

Use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` for fetching posts. This free API is perfect for demo purposes.

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, you've learned how to effectively integrate APIs with Next.js applications. Key takeaways include:

- Setting up and running a Next.js project
- Employing server-side rendering with `getServerSideProps` for dynamic data fetching
- Using static generation (`getStaticProps`) for improved performance
- Handling dynamic routes with `getStaticPaths`
- Building a cohesive example project to practice your new skills

Feel free to experiment further with different APIs and configurations to deepen your understanding. In the next chapter, we'll delve into best practices for API error handling and response management. Keep on hacking!
