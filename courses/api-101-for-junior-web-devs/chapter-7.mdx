# Authentication in APIs

## Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 7 of "API 101 for Junior Web Devs", where we'll dive deep into the world of **authentication in APIs**. With APIs providing data and functionalities over the web, securing these endpoints is crucial. In this chapter, you'll learn about various authentication methods, understand how to secure API requests, and implement authentication in a React application. Let's get cracking!

## Overview of Authentication and Authorization

Before we jump into specific methods, let's clarify the difference between authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication**: This is the process of verifying who you are. When you log in to a website, you are authenticated to use that site.
  
- **Authorization**: This determines what you're allowed to do. For example, whether you're permitted to access specific resources or data.

Properly authenticating and authorizing API requests is vital to ensure security and data integrity.

## Common Methods of Authentication

### API Keys

- **API Keys** are a simple string provided to the developer who wants to use your API. They allow you to track and control how the API is used, helping to prevent abuse.
  
- Often not considered a secure way to protect advanced APIs, but they are easy to implement and manage for basic use cases.

#### Example of Using API Keys:
```javascript
// This example uses the Fetch API to make a GET request with an API key
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### OAuth (Open Authorization)

- **OAuth** is a more secure protocol that allows third-party apps to access user data without revealing user credentials.
  
- Mostly used for logging into apps using credentials from another service like Google or Facebook.

- **OAuth 2.0** is the more widely used version that optimizes for web applications and offers features like token expiration and refreshing.

#### Example OAuth Flow:
- User is redirected to an authorization server (Google).
- User logs in, and is then redirected back to your app with an authorization code.
- Your app exchanges the code for an access token.
- Use the access token to access the API.

```javascript
// Redirect user for Google OAuth
window.location.href = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...'
```

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

- **JWT** is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
  
- It's self-contained, meaning it includes all the necessary information about the user.

- Used for secure transactions, efficient verification, and can be easily validated via public/private keys.

#### Example JWT:
```javascript
// Using JSON Web Token for API request
const token = '<your_jwt_token>';
fetch('https://api.example.com/secure-data', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Securing API Requests in Client Applications

- Always use HTTPS to ensure data encryption between the client and server.
  
- Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the source code; instead, make use of environment variables.
  
- Regularly rotate your credentials (API keys, tokens) to reduce potential exposure.

## Implementing Authentication in a React Application

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Set Up Authentication Context**
   - First, set up a context to manage authentication state across your React application.

   ```javascript
   import { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

   const AuthContext = createContext();

   export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [auth, setAuth] = useState(null);

     return (
       <AuthContext.Provider value={{ auth, setAuth }}>
         {children}
       </AuthContext.Provider>
     );
   }

   export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
   ```

2. **Authenticate User**
   - Handling login and storing tokens.

   ```javascript
   // Use the context in a component
   const { setAuth } = useAuth();

   const loginUser = async (username, password) => {
     const response = await fetch('/login', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ username, password })
     });

     if (response.ok) {
       const data = await response.json();
       setAuth(data.token); // store token in context
     } else {
       console.error('Login failed');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Create middleware to authorize actions based on roles or permissions.

   ```javascript
   const ProtectedRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => {
     const { auth } = useAuth();
     return auth ? <Component {...rest} /> : <Redirect to="/login" />;
   }
   ```

## Practical Exercises

1. **Exercise 1: Implement Basic Authentication**
   - Create a React app that uses a login form to request an API and handle authentication using JWT. Ensure the token is stored securely and verify API calls work with protected endpoints.

2. **Exercise 2: Setup OAuth with a Third-Party Service**
   - Integrate Google OAuth into a simple React app, allowing users to log in with their Google accounts. Display the user's profile data from Google upon successful login.

## Chapter Summary

In this chapter, you explored various authentication strategies for securing APIs, including API keys, OAuth, and JWT. You learned how to implement these techniques in a React application to enhance security and manage user sessions. Authentication is critical to any web application interacting with APIs, and now you have the tools to effectively safeguard your projects against unauthorized access. Onward to mastery for API integration!

Happy coding!
